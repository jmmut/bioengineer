# Design

In this document I will write about the design decisions I'm making during the development of 
this game.

## Motivation

Basically, I want to play to a game like factorio, with height levels and a more wholesome goal 
than killing aliens and launch a rocket.

## Inspirations

Funnily enough, the features I want for this game are best represented by other games, not 
factorio; but factorio is the one that gets the closest overall.

- Factorio
  - Automation
  - Sense of scale
  - Big map
  - Dynamic cycles
  - 3rd person
- Terra nil
  - Removing yourself
  - Terraforming
  - 3rd person
  - Voxels
- Dwarf fortress
  - Height levels
    - Anthill bases
  - Collateral lore
  - Dynamic cycles
  - Automation
  - 3rd person
  - Voxels
- Universal paperclips
  - Sense of scale
  - Removing yourself

### Sense of scale

I would like the game to give the user the experience of doing something across many orders of 
magnitude. Start creating units of some resource, ending up creating millions, billions or 
trillions of that resource.

Not many things have trillions of elements, but terraforming a planet does involve such scales.

### Removing yourself

I find it quite poetic if you see your end as the next step. Even if it's just reducing your tools
or your power because that's the sensible next step.

Some games like Terra Nil and Universal Paperclips do this, but I don't think many other games have 
done it.

### Height levels

There are many base building games, but very few allow doing real 3D structures. I can count 
Dwarf Fortress and Minecraft in this category, and both give a unique sense of deep base design.

Minecraft bases are usually above ground but I find myself doing anthills most of the time, as 
when playing Dwarf Fortress.
