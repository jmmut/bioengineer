# Design

In this document I will write about the design decisions I'm making during the development of 
this game.

## Motivation

Basically, I want to play to a game like factorio, with height levels and a more wholesome goal 
than killing aliens and launch a rocket.

## Inspirations

Funnily enough, the features I want for this game are best represented by other games, not 
factorio; but factorio is the one that gets the closest overall.

- Factorio
  - Automation
  - Sense of scale
  - Big map
  - Dynamic cycles
  - 3rd person
- Terra nil
  - Removing yourself
  - Terraforming
  - 3rd person
  - Voxels
- Dwarf fortress
  - Height levels
    - Anthill bases
  - Collateral lore
  - Dynamic cycles
  - Automation
  - 3rd person
  - Voxels
- Minecraft
  - Height levels
  - Chill music
  - Voxels
  - Big map
- Universal paperclips
  - Sense of scale
  - Removing yourself

### Sense of scale

I would like the game to give the user the experience of doing something across many orders of 
magnitude. Start creating units of some resource, ending up creating millions, billions or 
trillions of that resource.

Not many things have trillions of elements, but terraforming a planet does involve such scales.

### Removing yourself

I find it quite poetic if you see your end as the next step. Even if it's just reducing your tools
or your power because that's the sensible next step.

Some games like Terra Nil and Universal Paperclips do this, but I don't think many other games have 
done it.

### Height levels

There are many base building games, but very few allow doing real 3D structures. I can count 
Dwarf Fortress and Minecraft in this category, and both give a unique sense of deep base design.

Minecraft bases are usually above ground but I find myself doing anthills most of the time, as 
when playing Dwarf Fortress.

## Sound/music

The music has to be something like the OST of Factorio or Minecraft. Not very intrusive so that
you can focus, but chill and wholesome.

I would like the music to change depending on the terraforming stage. At the beginning, the ambient
should be space-y and misterious. To convey the feeling of being abandoned by yourself in a barren
planet (think pads and strings). Then, the more infrastructure you deploy, the more it feels like
home, with industrial touches (think Factorio, Rammstein or Slipknot, but chill). Then, when 
you introduce life, the music must convey nature and life (think flutes).


## Making the game design more specific

- how do you play
- mechanics
- controls
- levels
- progression
- story
- ending
- characters
- worldbuilding
- graphics
- UI
- hours of content
- payment
- platform (touchscreen?) and requirement (licenses, hardware)

## Further plan

### Resources

- requires other people?
- budget

### Proof of concept

make sure it's possible

### prototype iteratively

- version of the game ugly but fun
- change things that don't work

### Demo

graphics and music close to finished, all mechanics but not all content.

### Funding

publisher or crowdfunding

### trailer and steam page

get wishlists

### publish the demo

- get feedback, create community
- send trailer to press
- send demo to streamers

### review this Game Design Document

answer any remaining questions

## Production of the full game

- calendar plan
- make alpha version (main storyline complete, may lack secondary missions or
secondary objects)
- make beta version (release candidate for final testing and polishing)
- launch marketing: update trailer with date announcement, update store pages
- polish beta
- launch trailer: 2-3 weeks before send keys to press and streamers

## Post-production

maintain and maybe expand:
- bug reports
- new languages
- extra content
