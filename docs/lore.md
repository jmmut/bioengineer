## Western generation summary

Each generation was born between:

- Zoomers: 1997 - 2012
- Generation alpha: 2013 - 2028

- Generation eta: 2109 - 2124
- Generation theta: 2125 - 2145

## Western generation description

Following the analogy of:
- Strong people create great times
- Great times create weak people
- Weak people create bad times
- Bad times create strong people

TODO: outdated: technology goes faster than this.
Millenials saw in their youth, powerless, how the technology changed the jobs, creating chaos.
Zoomers were almost phone/smartphone native, and rode the chaos without much thought.
Alphas understood the chaos and resolved to change it. They were the pioneers of the 21st century renaissance.
Betas continued and polished Alpha's trend. The golden period of the 21st century was under Beta's command.
Gammas were born in an optimistic scenario and just maintained Beta's work without improving it.
Deltas grew up in the most comfortable society in history, and became greedy.
Epsilons' early infancy was great, but they saw during their life how everything became worse.
Zetas never experienced the golden years, and while their infancy was still not awful, their adulthood was.
Etas had a miserable and powerless life.
Thetas were barely a generation, and were the last humans before the collapse.

## Timeline

In the late 2020s and early 2030s, Millennial were in average 40 years old, conforming the main
commanding generation in society. They had seen how life conditions worsened as they grew up and
wanted to take control back but didn't manage to change much.

It was the Zoomers, who had grown up in the chaos of smartphones and social media, who were able
to tame corporations in the 2040s and early 2050s. Corporations had become as powerful as full
countries by that time, but Zoomers understood technology and AI and knew how to regulate it in an
innovative way that previous generations couldn't.

During the late 2050s, Alphas continued that trend and by the end of the 2060s the improvements
peaked. The Zoomers' had produced innovative technology and this golden years managed to improve it
and integrate it in society in a healthier way than previous generations. Alphas and Betas grew up
with global communication, which reduced the cultural differences between the western and eastern
countries. The stability and growth of the international Mars station was the emblem of human
achievement.

Betas in the 2070s didn't change much and technology pretty much evolved on its own, but social
improvements remained the same. Research on asteroid mining was often the topic of discussion in
the media, and humans and robots were working on it with a similar amount of responsibility. In the
2080s corporations started their answer to the constraints from the 2050s with mass social
engineering.

TODO: finish humans

# Robots era

- 2020s: Non-intelligent robots, with minimal flow of movement.
- 2030s: First robot pets. Partial automation of trivial jobs by AI.
- 2040s: First automated physical workers in simple jobs.
- 2050s: Considerable automation of intellectual jobs like science and software.
- 2060s: First robot assistants in homes.
- 2070s: Considerable automation in physical and intellectual jobs like engineering.
- 2080s: Considerable automation on mass social engineering for corporations.

were in average 40 years old, conforming the main commanding generation. They
started changing how institutions and governments work, imposing tough restrictions on corporations,
which had become as powerful as full countries by that time. Individual privacy was long gone, and
individual freedom was almost nonexistent due to the corporations' modern slavery, but freedom was
still not dead. Many new laws started giving freedom back to the people. Governments took interest
in the kind of space exploration research that corporations had been starting by that time.

By the late 2070s Betas continued that trend and by the 2080s the improvements peaked. The Zoomers'
work slavery had produced innovative technology and this golden years managed to improve it and
integrate it in society in a healthier way than previous generations. Betas grew up with global
communication, which reduced the cultural differences between the western and eastern countries.
The stability and growth of the international Mars station was the emblem of human achievement.

Gammas in the 2090s didn't change much and technology pretty much evolved on its own, but social
improvements remained the same. Research on asteroid mining was often the topic of discussion in
the media, and humans and robots were working on it with a similar amount of responsibility.

Deltas didn't need to fight in their youth, and by the late 2100s they were controlling society
and were taking advantage of the system for their own, starting the decline. Corporations took a
turn, finally answering to the government constraints from the 2080s. Gammas' technology improvement
speed was quicker than social improvement speed, and governments were again incapable of keeping up
the pace. Corporations had a lot of automated workforce, and they turned that power to do social
engineering. By the 2110s this was the norm. Asteroid mining were the new coal mines where humans
were exploited. Some small colonies of workers were created in Mars.

Epsilons' life was marked by the sense of losing grip on a utopia, and they could only continue
Deltas' abuse in the hope of regaining the status they were losing every year. In the 2120s and
2130s they started taking control over Deltas, but they continued doing the same out of desperation,
instead of out of greed. This period saw research projects similar to asteroid mining but more
ambitious. The dream was establishing mining infrastructure on the moons of the gas giants, or even
out of the solar system. The colonies in Mars expanded as the automated mining still required
considerable human supervision.

Zetas in the 2140s were almost as numerous as Epsilons, but they were powerless in comparison. Older
Epsilons were the heads of corporations and even some late Deltas were still quite powerful due to
improvements in life expectancy. Zetas started working in the Mars colonies quite young, and that
was not a great place to create families, so Epsilons and Zetas didn't have many children.

Etas didn't get the change to receive the broken society. They were a smaller generation because
Epsilons and especially Zetas didn't get family benefits. They didn't manage to create enough
people to conform the next generation. Some powerful Epsilons and a couple Deltas were the de-facto
rulers of the world, fighting each other for the polluted land on Earth, control of the Mars
colonies and mining rights. The Final war started with an attack on 2143.

Thetas were still mostly children during the Final War. The war destroyed with tactical attacks the
few elements on Earth that sustained life. The skies darkened, the dirt soured, the seas thickened.
Hunger hit. Death was quick. The colonies were not fully self-sufficient and crumbled under civil
wars for resources. War robots were more successful than life-sustaining robots. The last humans
were rich people that were exterminated in their bunkers by robot soldiers sent by their enemies.

TODO technology goes too fast

- 2120s: Considerable automation of asteroid mining jobs.
- 2130s: Considerable automation of jobs about designing space exploration. The Panspermia project is conceived.
- 2140s: Full automation of warfare.
- 2150s: Full automation of most industries with no ultimate goal. The Panspermia project starts its execution phase.
- 2160s: Emergence of robot government to organise endeavors across the whole solar system. The Panspermia project gets cancelled. TODO shorten these 2 sentences.
